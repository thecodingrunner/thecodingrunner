# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Finn
#### Front End React Developer
I create creative websites and applications using the MERN stack. After graduating with a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering, and living in Japan for 6 months, I discovered Web Development, and since then have committed myself to becoming a professional developer. The concept of creating creative and stylish web solutions and applications is exciting to me.
